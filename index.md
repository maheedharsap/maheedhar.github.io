Research projects 
 Assistive Diagnostic Tool for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation using Computer Vision
Computer Vision was applied and specifically a Mask R CNN segmentation model was implemented
through transfer learning. Used Google Cloud VM Services in order to train and validate the model.
09/2019 – 04/2020
A Novel Approach to the Diagnosis of Heart Disease Using Machine Learning and Deep Neural
Networks
Used Google TensorFlow and scikit-learn to develop machine learning models and neural networks.
Various optimization and hyper parametrization techniques were applied to increase the accuracy
prediction rate of heart disease. At the end, an application was created for assisted heart disease
diagnosis.
10/2018 – 05/2019
Correlation Between GPS Error Signals and Geomagnetic Acitivity
Investigated the correlation between GPS errors and geomagnetic activity in the ionosphere. Specifics of
this correlation and the affected values/systems were discovered as well.
